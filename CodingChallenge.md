# Coding Challenge  
  
Microsoft's engineers developed a video indexer for a 15-second video, executing in 40 seconds on a CPU-only developer machine.
  
- Develop a faster offline solution.  
- No cloud services allowed, except for GitHub Codespaces.  
- The solution should run on-premise in Linux offline mode.  
- Use the most powerful CPU-only Codespaces machine.  
- Leverage all your ML, coding, and AI skills for offline mode.  
  
## Success Criteria  
  
Provide a detailed summary of the video. The summary must include:  
  
- A man with a gun.  
- Followed by a car explosion and fire.  
- Ending with the man standing with arms stretched or dancing.  
  
## Technical Requirements  
  
- There should be a stopwatch from the main method until after the summary of the video, outputting the seconds or minutes it took to make the summary.  
- GitHub CoPilot and GitHub Codespaces.  
- Allowed to use Codespaces with 16 cores and 64 GB RAM, no GPU.  
- No cloud services allowed, but downloading and using models locally is permitted. You can use Hugging Face, Ollama, or any tools that help you use AI in offline mode on your localhost.  
  
## Skills Required  
  
- Use of AI to optimize algorithms and code.  
- Coding skills.  
- Prompting skills.  
- Time management skills.  
  
## Group Requirements  
  
Your group should consist of developers and data scientists.
